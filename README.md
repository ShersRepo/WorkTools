File directory creator utility
This tool was designed for a printing firm to simplify the process of creating file directory system. It implements a text file system as a way of tracking user settings such as saved customers and descriptions for jobs. These are initialised on startup of the application automatically. 
On initial start up default file locations need to be set up. This can be done with the following steps:

1. Click on preferences on the menu bar and select "Set Default Location". This will
create a default location that will be saved and used for all future uses. Please note no files
must be moved from the application folder in order for this to work.

2. Repeat step 1 except from the menu bar choose "Set InternalJobLocations". This will set the
default location for the internal job structure.

3. Decide whether Internal Jobs or Printing Team Job Folders are required, then fill out the 
appropriate forms as required.

4. Once all conditions are satisfied, click on create folder or select folder to save the folder
directories.
